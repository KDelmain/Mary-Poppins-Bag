Double Linked List Practice

I created this project to practice with double linked lists.

Currently, only the menu options to shake bag (1), peek inside of bag (2), add item to bag (4), and leave (6) are functional. 

DoubleLinkedBag.hpp is currently making singularly linked lists, and still needs to have functions fixed to incorperate double linked lists.
